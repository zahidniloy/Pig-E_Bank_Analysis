    OBJECTIVE

Identify the top risk factors that contribute to client loss and model them in a decision tree.


    PROBLEM

The bank’s sales team wants to increase customer retention by identifying the leading indicators that a customer will leave the bank.

    Identifying types of bias and ethical dilemmas:
•	Calculating descriptive statistics
•	Pivot tables
•	Creating a decision tree model using Excel

    KEYNOTES:
•	The data cleaning process involved standardizing country codes, addressing missing values through imputation and removal, and ensuring data consistency across key variables. (Based on "2. Cleaning the data" sheet)

    Key Insights
    What are the bank’s former clients?
1. Customers who have left the bank show distinct characteristics when compared to active customers, highlighting potential risk factors. 
2. Where are the bank’s former clients from?
3. The geographic distribution of churned customers provides insights into regional risk factors that may influence customer attrition.

    RECOMMENDATIONS
    
1. Re-engage Inactive Members: Inactive customers are 3x more likely to leave. Target the top 25% of inactive customers (based on balance) with re-activation offers.
   
2. Improve German Customer Service: Germany has a 33% churn rate, higher than France (17%) or Spain (16%). Boost German-speaking staff by 20% and address local issues.
   
3. Tailor Offers Based on Product Holdings: Customers with 3 products churn at 85%. Offer financial reviews to consolidate or better align their products.
   
4. Target 40-50 Age Range: 40% of churned clients are 40-50 years old. Provide free retirement or financial planning sessions to this group.
